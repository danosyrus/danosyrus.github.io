I graduated from high school with a focus on Commerce with Computer Science in 2023. My strong interest in programming and designing led me to pursue a career as a Full Stack Developer & Designer. Currently, I'm enrolled in a Python full-stack development course while also practicing Mixed Martial Arts.</p>
