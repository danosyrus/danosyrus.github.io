        <p class="lead">Hello, I am Dano Syrus, a full-stack freelance developer based in India.I graduated from high
          school with a focus on Commerce with Computer Science in 2023. It's been about 3 to 4 years since I delved
          into programming and the tech industry.<br><br>I began my journey by developing and creating Discord bots, and since
          then, my exploration and learning have continued. I've had experience with a variety
          of tools and programming languages. Since I began learning programming, I've started working on
          projects, all of which you can find on my GitHub profile. My strong interest in programming and
          designing led me to pursue a career as a Full Stack Developer & Designer.<br><br>Currently, I'm enrolled in
          a Python full-stack development course while also mastering Mixed Martial Arts. It's worth noting
          that I'm a huge fan of Mixed Martial Arts and am dedicated to mastering a wide variety of them. I
          strongly believe in doing my best and always aiming for excellence in everything I do. I'm eager to
          receive your messages! Feel free to reach out to me through my socials.</p>
